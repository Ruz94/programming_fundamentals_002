In what data type have we chosen to represent a book?
The catalogue is a complex data type of Array containing books which are primitive data types of string

Is this the best data type, do you think? Could we have chosen a more appropriate data type? Why?
I think a object would've been a better data type. This would've made it easier to reference the key-value pairs, for e.g.
the book could've been defined as an object with two properties of title and author.

Take a read of the Jest Documentation about Matchers such as toBe and toEqual. What other matchers might come in useful? Check the tests you have written and make a list of alternative matchers which you might have been able to use.
toBeTruthy / toBeFalsy - returns true/false if the book in question in the checkBook function did or didn't exist in the array catalogue.
toContain - if no books begun with the first letter

What data types are considered "complex" data types?
Arrays
Objects

What data types are considered "primitive" data types?
null
undefined
boolean
number
string

In JavaScript it is possible to use == ("double equals") or === ("triple equals") to compare two values. What is the difference and why do we prefer triple equals?
The double equals will convert two values in an argument to the same data type before comparing the two values. 
The triple equals is preffered over the == as it compares the value and the data type to make sure that they are the exact same for e.g.

const myInt = 1
const myBoolean = true
myInt === myBoolean; //this would be false
myInt == myBoolean; //this would be true

In the first statement, the values assigned to the variables myInt and myBoolean have different data types therefore it returns false.
Whereas in the second statement, the variable myBoolean is converted into an int and therefore given the value of 1 which makes it equal to myInt which then returns true.
